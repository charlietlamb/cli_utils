# Cli Utils - Rust

This is the very first project I've created in rust after going through the first chapters of the rust book.

This project contains the following commands:

- grep
- find
- cat
- cd
- ls
- echo
- help

## grep

In grep * can be used to search for all files in a directory.

### grep flags

| Flag | Function                               |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| -c   | Outputs the count of each target found |
| -v   | Reverses the grep logic                |
| -i   | Ignores case                           |
| -n   | Add line numbers                       |

## ls

### ls flags

| Flag | Function                          |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| -a   | Include files starting with a dot |
